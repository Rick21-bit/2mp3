WHAT IS 2.MP3?
2mp3 is a python project started in july 29 to convert any media files to mp3 as a result of 17 year old me buying a STN-13 headphone and wanting to copy all musical videos into a memory card converting it to mp3.

THE PROJECT IDEA
the script will be a command line interface.
It will have two options one to directly download from youtube and convert it to mp3 or
Converting a selected file(s) to mp3

The script will have two phrases 
1 - converting it to mp3
2 - transferring the converted mp3 to the memory.

EXECUTION
I will be using four modules here 
1 - youtube.dl  // To download mp3 from YouTube 
2 - Python shutil - To transfer files
3 - Os [os.listdir()]- For directory and file mangement 
4 - moviepy - to convert video media files to mp3
